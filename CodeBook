variables

The dataset contains measurements made from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
All the measurements initially are designated as training data or test data. Variable names are given in features.txt
We read in the data and merge the training and test data, as we aren't concerned with the distinction. 
We use the names in features.txt to label each column of the data.
We only want to keep measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Based on the information provided in features_info.txt, we learn that all measurements on the mean have "mean()" in the label,
and all measurements on the standard deviation have "std()" in the label. 
Based on this, we throw out all other columns in the data
The activities are stored in separate files from the measured data. 
We merge this into our data frame, adding a new column for the activity. 
We also convert the integers representing each activity with descriptive activity names. 
We get this mapping from activity_labels.txt.
The subjects are stored in separate files from the measured data. 
We merge this into our data frame, adding a new column for the subject.
generate new dataset of averages

We create a new tidy dataset which contains the average for each measurement we have kept, 
for each activity and each subject. 
As there are 6 activities and 30 subjects, this means that our new tidy dataset has 180 rows.
